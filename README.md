BlueLedger: Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV System

Overview

BlueLedger is a modular, open-source registry that mints, sells, and retires blue carbon credits using blockchain. It turns coastal restoration into a verifiable climate currency by combining satellite-derived MRV, on-chain tokenization, and auditable retirement certificates.

Problem Context (SIH25038)

Coastal ecosystems sequester significant carbon, but verification is fragmented, double-counting risks exist, and community revenue sharing is opaque. A national-scale, auditable registry is needed to standardize MRV, prevent double issuance, and enable transparent markets.

Proposed Solution

- User onboards a project using a GeoJSON file (coastline/plot boundaries, metadata).
- MRV pipeline uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) with an NDVI/biomass model plus field data to estimate carbon stock and deltas.
- Chainlink oracle brings signed MRV results on-chain.
- ERC-1155 tokens represent fungible blue carbon credits; evidence and MRV artifacts are stored on IPFS/Filecoin.
- Retirement burns ERC-1155 units and mints a unique ERC-721 NFT certificate with immutable evidence references.
- Payments via MetaMask and USDC; revenue sharing supports coastal communities.

Why It Works

- Verifiable: Independent MRV artifacts anchored on-chain with reproducible pipelines.
- Non-double-counted: Credit IDs bind to project, vintage, and geospatial footprint; retirement is globally unique per unit.
- Auditable: Evidence CIDs (MRV data, model params, verifier attestations) are immutably referenced.
- Scalable: Modular stack, Polygon/Arbitrum deployments, oracle-agnostic.

Key Features

- Project onboarding via GeoJSON and metadata
- Automated MRV (GEE + NDVI biomass) with field-calibration
- Oracle-bridged MRV attestations
- ERC-1155 credit minting, transfer, marketplace compatibility
- ERC-721 retirement certificates (proof of burn)
- IPFS/Filecoin storage for evidence
- USDC payments, MetaMask integration

KPIs (2025 Pilot Targets)

- 3 projects onboarded
- 10,000 tCO2e measured
- 500 credits issued
- Revenue generated and shared with communities

Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Blockchain: Solidity on Polygon/Arbitrum; ERC-1155 (credits) + ERC-721 (retirements)
- Off-chain Storage: IPFS + Filecoin
- MRV: Google Earth Engine, NDVI Biomass Model, field data
- Oracle: Chainlink (MRV data to chain)

High-Level Flow

1) Project Onboarding → Upload GeoJSON + metadata
2) MRV Run → GEE computes NDVI/biomass; field data calibrates; results exported
3) Oracle Attestation → Chainlink posts MRV summary hash and data to contract
4) Mint Credits → ERC-1155 tokens minted, linked to IPFS evidence CIDs
5) Payment & Transfer → USDC via MetaMask
6) Retirement → Burn ERC-1155, mint ERC-721 certificate (NFT)

Risks & Mitigations

- Satellite noise / data accuracy → Temporal compositing, QA masks, field plots, uncertainty bounds
- High gas fees → Batch mints, L2 (Polygon/Arbitrum), off-chain storage of heavy artifacts
- Community onboarding → Simple UX, custodial options, revenue share templates, local partners
- Oracle integrity → DON-based oracles, signed payloads, replay protection, versioned schemas

Roadmap

- MVP: Project onboarding, MRV ingest, oracle attestation, ERC-1155 mint, ERC-721 retire
- V1: Marketplace integration, USDC flows, verifier roles, dashboards
- V2: APIs for third-party registries and DAO governance toward a national registry
