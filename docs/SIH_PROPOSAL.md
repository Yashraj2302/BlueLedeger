# SIH 2025 Proposal: BlueLedger System

## Problem Statement ID: SIH25038
**Theme**: Environment & Climate Tech

## Proposed Solution: BlueLedger System

BlueLedger System is a blockchain-based registry that mints, sells, and retires blue carbon credits. Blue carbon refers to carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems. The system aims to turn coastal restoration into a verifiable climate currency.

## How the System Works

### 1. Project Onboarding
- A user onboards a project using a **GeoJSON file** containing coastal ecosystem boundaries and metadata
- System validates geographic data and project parameters
- Creates immutable project record on blockchain

### 2. Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)
- Uses **satellite imagery and field data** for MRV
- Leverages **Google Earth Engine** and the **NDVI Biomass Model** for accurate carbon measurement
- Combines remote sensing with ground truth data for validation
- Generates verifiable carbon stock assessments

### 3. Oracle Integration
- **Chainlink oracle** brings the real-world MRV data onto the blockchain
- Ensures data integrity and transparency
- Provides tamper-proof verification of carbon measurements

### 4. Token Minting
- System mints tokens using the **ERC-1155 standard**
- Evidence stored on **IPFS** for immutable verification
- Each token represents a specific amount of verified carbon credits

### 5. Credit Retirement
- Credits are retired using an **ERC-721 token**
- Results in a unique **NFT retirement certificate**
- Prevents double-counting of credits
- Provides permanent record of climate action

### 6. Revenue Sharing
- Process provides **revenue sharing for coastal communities**
- Payments handled using **MetaMask Wallet and USDC**
- Transparent and automated distribution system

## Technology and Feasibility

### Modular, Open-Source Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, deployed on Polygon/Arbitrum, using ERC-1155 and ERC-721 standards
- **Storage**: IPFS and Filecoin

### Risk Mitigation

The team has identified and provided mitigations for potential risks:

1. **Data Accuracy Issues from Satellite Noise**
   - **Mitigation**: Temporal compositing, QA masks, field plots, uncertainty bounds
   - **Solution**: Multi-sensor validation and ground truth calibration

2. **High Gas Fees**
   - **Mitigation**: Batch mints, L2 deployment (Polygon/Arbitrum), off-chain storage
   - **Solution**: Layer 2 scaling and optimized smart contract design

3. **Challenges with Community Onboarding**
   - **Mitigation**: Simple UX, custodial options, revenue share templates, local partners
   - **Solution**: User-friendly interfaces and community education programs

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**2025 Pilot Targets**:
- **3 projects** onboarded
- **10,000 tCO2e** (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) measured
- **500 credits** issued
- **Generated revenue** for coastal communities

## Long-term Vision

The long-term vision is to use **APIs and DAO governance** to create a **national registry**, enabling:

- **Scalable Blue Carbon Markets**: Nationwide adoption of blue carbon credit trading
- **Community Empowerment**: Direct revenue sharing with coastal communities
- **Climate Impact**: Significant contribution to India's carbon neutrality goals
- **Transparent Governance**: Decentralized decision-making through DAO mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Registry.sol**: Project management and MRV attestations
- **Credits1155.sol**: ERC-1155 fungible carbon credits
- **Retirement721.sol**: ERC-721 unique retirement certificates
- **DAOGovernance.sol**: Community governance and decision-making

### MRV Pipeline
- **Google Earth Engine**: Satellite data processing
- **NDVI Biomass Model**: Carbon stock estimation
- **Field Data Integration**: Ground truth validation
- **Chainlink Oracle**: On-chain data verification

### Storage and Infrastructure
- **IPFS**: Decentralized evidence storage
- **Filecoin**: Long-term data persistence
- **Polygon/Arbitrum**: Low-cost blockchain deployment
- **Vercel**: Scalable web hosting

## Innovation Highlights

1. **First Blue Carbon Registry**: Specialized focus on coastal ecosystems
2. **Integrated MRV**: Seamless satellite and field data integration
3. **Community-Centric**: Direct revenue sharing with local communities
4. **Transparent Governance**: DAO-based decision making
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for national-scale deployment

## Impact and Benefits

### Environmental Impact
- **Carbon Sequestration**: Measurable blue carbon capture
- **Ecosystem Restoration**: Incentivized coastal restoration
- **Climate Action**: Contribution to India's climate goals

### Economic Impact
- **Community Revenue**: Direct financial benefits to coastal communities
- **Market Creation**: New economic opportunities in blue carbon
- **Job Creation**: Employment in MRV and restoration activities

### Social Impact
- **Community Empowerment**: Local decision-making through DAO
- **Education**: Awareness about blue carbon and climate action
- **Transparency**: Open and auditable carbon credit system

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
- Project onboarding via GeoJSON
- Basic MRV pipeline with GEE
- ERC-1155 credit minting
- ERC-721 retirement certificates

### Phase 2: V1 (6 months)

- Advanced MRV capabilities

## Conclusion

BlueLedger System represents a comprehensive solution for blue carbon credit management, combining cutting-edge technology with community-centric design. The system addresses critical challenges in carbon credit verification while providing tangible benefits to coastal communities and contributing to India's climate action goals.

The modular, open-source architecture ensures scalability and adaptability, while the focus on transparency and community empowerment sets a new standard for environmental credit systems.
